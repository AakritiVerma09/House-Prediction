# House-Prediction
This project aims to develop a predictive model for estimating house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and market trends. Utilizing machine learning techniques, the project analyzes historical housing data to identify patterns and correlations that influence pricing.

Future work will focus on incorporating more variables, such as economic forecasts and local amenities, to enhance predictive capabilities.
